Please extend my Next.js + Tailwind e-commerce project “GizmoTech” with a shopping cart feature.

Requirements:

Cart State Management

Use React Context or a simple global state (e.g., React Context API or Zustand) to manage the cart.

When a user clicks “Add to Cart” on any product card, the product should be added to the cart.

If the same product is added again, increase the quantity instead of duplicating the item.

Cart Page

Create a new page at /cart.

Display all products added to the cart in a list format. Each item should show:

Product image

Product name

Price

Quantity (with + / - buttons to adjust)

Remove button (to delete item from cart).

Show a Cart Summary at the bottom with:

Total items

Total price

A placeholder “Checkout” button (no payment integration yet).

Styling

Use Tailwind CSS with the GizmoTech theme (black background, white text, neon blue highlights).

Cart items should be displayed in a clean card/list style.

Checkout button should be styled with neon blue and hover effects.

Navigation

Add a Cart link in the navbar that shows the number of items in the cart (e.g., 🛒 3).

Clicking the cart link should take the user to /cart.
